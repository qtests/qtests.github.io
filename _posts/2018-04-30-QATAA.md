### Quantitative Approach To Tactical Asset Allocation

In 2006 Mebane T. Faber has published an article [A Quantitative Approach to Tactical Asset Allocation](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=962461) with a quite modest goal - to present a simple quantitative method that improves the risk-adjusted returns across various asset classes. The method could be seen as an asset allocation strategy or a market [timing model](http://mebfaber.com/timing-model/). The intuition is that a market timing solution serves as a risk-reduction technique that signals when to exit a risky asset class in favor of risk-free investments. It worked very well over years probably because of it's simplicity. The [Systematic Investor's Blog](http://systematicinvestor.github.io/strategy/Strategy-TAA) used to track the strategy performance but after mid-2016 it stopped. The goal of this post is to simply test and see how the strategy performed over the last two years.

The method or strategy allocates 20% across 5 asset classes:

-   US Stocks
-   Foreign Stocks
-   US 10YR Government Bonds
-   Real Estate
-   Commodities

based on the simple moving average rule:

-   any asset is bought when it's price &gt; 10-month SMA
-   the asset os sold and the proceedings are moved to cash when it's monthly price &lt; 10-month SMA

The model is only updated once a month on the last day of the month. In order to backtest the the [SIT toolbox](http://systematicinvestor.github.io/about/) is used. In addition, the extended historical data for the asset classes is sourced in the way that was discussed in the [blog](http://qtests.github.io/Starting-with-SIT/) earlier.

### Data

``` r
# Get the data
# More details - http://systematicinvestor.github.io/Data-Proxy
#                and http://qtests.github.io/Starting-with-SIT/
# make.data.proxy ()
load('data/data.proxy.raw.Rdata')

tickers = '
LQD + VWESX        #  LQD iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF
DBC + CRB          #  DBC PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund
VTI + VTSMX        #  VTI Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund
ICF + VGSIX        #  ICF iShares Cohen & Steers REIT ETF
CASH = SHY + TB3Y  #  SHY iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond ETF
'

data <- new.env()
getSymbols.extra(tickers, src = 'yahoo', from = '1970-01-01', env = data,
                 raw.data = data.proxy.raw, set.symbolnames = T, auto.assign = T)
```

``` r
for(i in data$symbolnames)
  data[[i]] = adjustOHLC(data[[i]], use.Adjusted=T)

cat ("\nStart Dates: \n")
print(bt.start.dates(data, ""))
```

    ## 
    ## Start Dates:
    ##                  
    ## CASH "1962-01-02"
    ## LQD  "1980-01-02"
    ## VTI  "1992-04-27"
    ## DBC  "1994-01-03"
    ## ICF  "1996-05-13"

``` r
cat ("\nEnd Dates: \n")
print(bt.end.dates(data, ""))
```

    ## 
    ## End Dates:
    ##                  
    ## DBC  "2018-05-04"
    ## VTI  "2018-05-04"
    ## CASH "2018-05-04"
    ## ICF  "2018-05-04"
    ## LQD  "2018-05-04"

``` r
bt.prep(data, align='remove.na', fill.gaps = T)

cat ("\nLast Prices: \n")
print(last(data$prices))
```

    ## 
    ## Last Prices:
    ## 	
    ##               LQD   DBC    VTI   ICF  CASH
    ## 2018-05-04 114.67 17.69 137.13 95.33 83.19

### Setup

``` r
# Setup
# -------------------------------------------------------------
data$universe <- data$prices > 0

# do not allocate to CASH
data$universe$CASH <- NA

prices <- data$prices * data$universe
n <- ncol(prices)
nperiods <- nrow(prices)

frequency <- 'months'

# find period ends, can be 'weeks', 'months', 'quarters', 'years'
period.ends <- endpoints(prices, frequency)
period.ends <- period.ends[period.ends > 0]

models <- list()

commission <- list(cps = 0.01, fixed = 10.0, percentage = 0.0)
```

The benchmark portfolio for the QATAA strategy is naturally a static portfolio that allocates weights to all asset classes equally. It turns out that the later method generates quite sound and respectful performance. One of the references regarding the 1/N asset allocation rule is [a paper by L. Garlappi, V. DeMiguel and R. Uppal](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=676997).

#### 1/N Allocation

``` r
# 1/N Allocation

data$weight[] = NA
data$weight[period.ends,] = ntop(prices[period.ends,], n)
models$EqualWeight = bt.run.share(data, clean.signal=F, commission = commission, trade.summary=T, silent=T)
```

&#10;
#### QATAA Strategy

``` r
# The Quantitative Approach To Tactical Asset Allocation Strategy 

# compute 10 month moving average
sma = bt.apply.matrix(prices, SMA, 200)

# go to cash if prices falls below 10 month moving average
go2cash = prices < sma
go2cash = ifna(go2cash, TRUE)

# equal weight target allocation
target.allocation = ntop(prices,n)

# If asset is above it's 10 month moving average it gets allocation
weight = iif(go2cash, 0, target.allocation)

# otherwise, it's weight is allocated to cash
weight$CASH = 1 - rowSums(weight)

data$weight[] = NA
data$weight[period.ends,] = weight[period.ends,]
models$QATAA = bt.run.share(data, clean.signal=F, commission = commission, trade.summary=TRUE, silent=TRUE)
```
&#10;
#### Performance Reporting

``` r
# Performance

plotbt(models, plotX = T, log = 'y', LeftMargin = 3, main = NULL)
mtext('Cumulative Performance', side = 2, line = 1)
```

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/2018-04-30-QATAA_files/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)

``` r
cat ("\nPerformance Stats: \n\n")
knitr::kable(plotbt.strategy.sidebyside(models, make.plot=F, return.table=T))
```
